Gilmore, Ph.D. 2023-04-05 About the course The reproducibility crisis in science Much attention has focused on the reproducibility of research in psychology, but the challenges of producing robust and reliable knowledge extend to all scientific disciplines. In this seminar, we will discuss whether there is or is not a reproducibility crisis in psychology and in science more broadly. We will discuss how initiatives to make scientific research more open and transparent can also make it more reproducible and robust. Instructor Rick O.

COVID safety information (last updated 2021-08-12) Please consult the Penn State Covid-19 Dashboard for updates on masking policies, instructional-mode changes, etc. https://virusinfo.psu.edu/covid-19-dashboard/. This class will meet in-person unless there is a change in University policy. Penn State University requires everyone to wear a face mask in all university buildings, including classrooms, regardless of vaccination status. ALL STUDENTS MUST wear a mask appropriately (i.e., covering both your mouth and nose) while you are indoors on campus. This is to protect your health and safety as well as the health and safety of your classmates, instructor, and the university community. Anyone attending class without a mask will be asked to put one on or leave. Instructors may end class if anyone present refuses to appropriately wear a mask for the duration of class. Students who refuse to wear masks appropriately may face disciplinary action for Code of Conduct violations. If you feel you cannot wear a mask during class, please speak with your adviser immediately about your options for altering your schedule. Zoom At some point in the semester, I may decide to use Zoom to allow students who are unable to attend class in person to participate. While you are on Zoom, keep in mind that this is a classroom environment and others should be treated with respect. Please keep your microphone muted unless you want to ask a question or interact with someone. If your microphone is not muted, the entire class will be able to hear what is going on in your environment. As an instructor, I personally like to see people’s faces. As a participant, I am more involved when I have my camera on. I realize, however, that there are many reasons why you might not want to turn on your camera such as poor internet connection, joining via phone, or other privacy concerns. It is your choice as to whether you would like to have the camera on or not.

The Penn State Principles were developed to embody the values that we hope our students, faculty, staff, administration, and alumni possess. At the same time, the University is strongly committed to freedom of expression. Consequently, these Principles do not constitute University policy and are not intended to interfere in any way with an individual’s academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse these common principles, thereby contributing to the traditions and scholarly heritage left by those who preceded them, and will thus leave Penn State a better place for those who follow. I will respect the dignity of all individuals within the Penn State community. The University is committed to creating and maintaining an educational environment that respects the right of all individuals to participate fully in the community. Actions motivated by hate, prejudice, or intolerance violate this principle. I will not engage in any behaviors that compromise or demean the dignity of individuals or groups, including intimidation, stalking, harassment, discrimination, taunting, ridiculing, insulting, or acts of violence. I will demonstrate respect for others by striving to learn from differences between people, ideas, and opinions and by avoiding behaviors that inhibit the ability of other community members to feel safe or welcome as they pursue their academic goals. I will practice academic integrity. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. In accordance with the University Code of Conduct, I will practice integrity in regard to all academic assignments. I will not engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception because such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others. I will demonstrate social and personal responsibility. The University is a community that promotes learning; any behaviors that are inconsistent with that goal are unacceptable. Irresponsible behaviors, including alcohol or drug abuse and the use of violence against people or property, undermine the educational climate by threatening the physical and mental health of members of the community. I will exercise personal responsibility for my actions and I will make sure that my actions do not interfere with the academic and social environment of the University. I will maintain a high standard of behavior by adhering to the Code of Conduct and respecting the rights of others. I will be responsible for my own academic progress and agree to comply with all University policies. The University allows students to identify and achieve their academic goals by providing the information needed to plan the chosen program of study and the necessary educational opportunities, but students assume final responsibility for course scheduling, program planning, and the successful completion of graduation requirements. I will be responsible for seeking the academic and career information needed to meet my educational goals by becoming knowledgeable about the relevant policies, procedures, and rules of the University and academic program, by consulting and meeting with my adviser, and by successfully completing all of the requirements for graduation. Penn State Values Integrity: We act with integrity and honesty in accordance with the highest academic, professional, and ethical standards.

Goals This exercise aims to to build your understanding about the relationship between alpha \\(\\alpha\\) and its close cousin statistical significance, statistical power (1-\\(\\beta\\)), effect size (\\(d\\)), and sample sizes (\\(n\\)). Materials a computer, tablet, or smartphone with access to the internet. a means of keeping brief notes (notebook or text/word processing document). Shiny app Visit the app at https://rogilmore.shinyapps.io/PSYCH490-2023-APES/. Background In the ideal world, we want large samples so that we can be confident that when we find differences between groups A and B (Americans and Europeans; males and females; soccer players and badminton players, etc.) that the differences we find are not due to chance. In the real world, there are always trade-offs between the size of the samples we can collect and our ability to avoid making mistakes about what’s true and what’s not. One way to think about those trade-offs is to think about our situation this way: Some “fact” about the world can either be true or false, and our data analysis should inform us about whether the fact is either true or false. We want to be right as often as possible. That means having a way of deciding something’s true when it actually is true and deciding when something’s false when it actually is false. Both are important ways for our analysis to be correct. We also want to avoid being wrong. We don’t want to decide something’s true when it’s not. That’s a false positive. We also don’t want to decide something’s false when actually it’s true. That’s called a false negative. We want to minimize both. To avoid false positives, we decide how often we are willing to be wrong in that way and set a criterion accordingly. The alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) value or criterion reflects that choice. It’s a probability, so it’s between 0 and 1. Since we want the fraction of the time we make false negative decisions to be small, \\(\\alpha\\) is also usually small; \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is conventional, but it is not in any way sacred. To avoid false negatives, we set another probability value, called beta (\\(\\beta\\)). Beta is the proportion of times we’re willing to conclude a true fact is actually false; \\(\\beta = 0.20\\) or 1 time out of five is conventional. But what data folks usually focus on is \\(1-\\beta\\)3 or statistical power. This number tells us the proportion of times we expect to detect a true effect when it’s actually there. Detecting the truth is sort of a scientific superpower, don’t you think? At least when things go right. Maybe that’s why it’s called power. Analysts who are planning a study have two other decisions to make: How big a sample should they collect, and how sensitive should their test be? The answer to how big a sample should always be large, but how large? The answer is, of course, called \\(n\\). How sensitive is the test can be asked this way: What’s the smallest difference I want to be able to detect–assuming I’m interested in the difference between condition A and condition B? That difference between conditions is called the effect size because it might represent the effect of some intervention. If we think effect sizes with respect to the standard normal (bell-curve-shaped) distribution with mean (\\(\\mu\\)) 0 and standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) 1, we can specify it in terms of the number of standard deviations. Specified this way, the effect size is usually called \\(d\\). There are other ways to talk about effect sizes, but we won’t go further here. Your goals in this assignment are to see how choices about sample size (\\(n\\)), effect size (\\(d\\)), alpha (\\(/alpha\\)) and power (\\(1-\\beta\\)) relate to one another. You’ll explore the effects of different values for these parameters, report on the parameters you chose, and what the results turned out to be. There are no right or wrong answers. Your analysis When you first open the app, note that it simulates an analysis of groups A (red) and B, and that we get to control a number of parameters, including \\(n\\), \\(d\\), and \\(\\alpha\\). Note the statistics in the first gray box. It reports on the results of a \\(t\\) test, comparing the difference between the means of the two groups. Interpret the results of the t-test. What does it mean? What is the number in the brackets? What does it mean? “CI” means confidence interval. The CI has a minimum (leftmost) and maximum (rightmost) value. The actual difference in the observed means of A and B should fall inside the interval. In your own words, explain what the confidence interval means. Let’s see what happens when we generate different samples of A and B with the same underlying statistics–the same \\(n\\), same mean (\\(\\mu\\)), same standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)), same effect size (\\(d\\)), and same criterion (\\(\\alpha\\)) or false positive rate. Press the Regenerate button. What happens to the histogram? Look in the grey t-test box. What happens to the t-test, and the mean values for A, B, the difference between A and B (B-A), and the CI? Press the Regenerate button a couple of times until Sig? changes from FALSE to TRUE or TRUE to FALSE? This is a form of p-hacking? Explain how. Remember the specific data we’re analyzing are being regenerated each time we press the button; what’s not changing is the sample size, standard deviation, and the effect size (difference between B and A). Having \\(n=75\\) is a pretty large sample for many types of research in psychology, so let’s see what having smaller samples does to our t-test and to our power. But before we do that, write down your prediction about what will happen to the t-test when we reduce the \\(n\\) for both groups A and B to 50. Change the \\(n\\) for A to 50 and the \\(n\\) for B to 50. Interpret the t-test and CI. What happened to power (see the box on the right side)? Does this mean we are more likely or less likely to detect a difference between A and B than before? Why? We’re simulating what happens if there is an effect size of \\(d=0.5\\), or half a standard deviation between the means of A and B. Change \\(d\\) to 1.5 or larger. What happens to the histogram? What happens to our t-test and power? Change \\(d\\) to 0.25. What happens to the histogram? What happens to our t-test and power? Let’s see if we can find out what size of samples we’d need to have power \\(1-\\beta = 0.80\\) to detect an effect of (\\(d=0.25\\)). Increase the sample sizes of A and B until you exceed the desired level for power. What sample size did you need? Explain your finding. (Optional) Bonus Points (up to 5) Explore the effect of changing some other parameter on the results, for example, criterion/alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)), the standard deviation for A or B (\\(\\sigma\\)), or even the ‘baseline’ mean for B (\\(\\mu\\)).

Goals Replication is one standard among many that can be used to evaluate scientific findings. In this exercise, you will evaluate a published scientific finding on the basis of whether it 1) replicates prior work and 2) could be replicated by someone else. Assignment Choose a published scientific paper on a topic you find interesting and important. Does the paper: Report on whether data reported replicate a prior finding? Does the paper embrace any of the recommendations by Begley (2013) (e.g., blinding, replication or repetition of key effects, etc.). Does the paper implement any of the recommendations from the Munafò et al. (2017) paper? Does the paper report effect sizes, sample sizes, and statistical power? Was the paper pre-registered? What is the TOP Factor for the journal? If none, report 0. Does the paper share data? If so, where? Could you get access to the data? Does the paper share any statistical or computer code used to analyze the data or make figures? If so, where? Could you access the code? Does the paper share sufficient information about the measures used (e.g., a protocol, computer code to generate computer tasks, specific survey questions, or other information needed to replicate the tasks or measures) so that an independent third party like yourself could replicate the study? If you had to give the author(s) of your paper a grade for replicability (A, B, C, D, F), what grade would you give it and why? Submit In a short (2-3 pp double-spaced report) discuss the paper’s finding and why you think it is interesting and important. Then, evaluate the paper from the perspective of “replicability” by answering the questions in the previous section.
